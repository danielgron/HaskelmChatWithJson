# HaskelmChatWithJson
Daniel G working together with Cherry Rose and Kristin

Working to the point where messages are encoded sent and decoded.
Has ChatMessage in use and sends content as "login" if userName is not set, and sets userName to message.
This is a shortcut reusing the text field.
Doesn't keep track of older messages yet.
